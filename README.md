# SprayHydraulic
A pipe Network hydraulic solver using Hazen-Williams equation

## Goal
The idea is to make a GUI application for calculating for fire spray/sprinkler networks.
In the distant future it will use `pyqt` to create the GUI. In the "not that distant" future, it will take
the network information from excel/ods files.

## Pre-requisites
`numpy`
`xlrd`
